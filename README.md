Modus is a language for building container images. Modus uses logic programming to solve key pain points of Dockerfiles â€” no way to express interaction among parameters, inability to specify complex build workflows, difficult and inefficient parallelisation, bloated images, and costly maintenance. For more information, please check [documentation](http://docs.modus-continens.com/). Modus uses semantic versioning; until version 1.0 is declared, breaking changes are possible. We welcome bug reports and feature requests submitted through [issues](https://github.com/mechtaev/modus/issues).
