Modus is a language for building OCI/Docker container images. Modus uses logic programming to solve key pain points of Dockerfiles - no way to express interaction among parameters, inability to specify complex build workflows, difficult and inefficient parallelisation, bloated images, and costly maintenance.

Modus uses semantic versioning; until version 1.0 is declared, breaking changes are possible. The current version, 0.1, is a preview release. We welcome bug reports and feature requests submitted through [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/mechtaev/modus/issues).
