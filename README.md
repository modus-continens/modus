Modus is a [Datalog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Datalog)-based domain-specific language for building [container](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OS-level_virtualization) images. Modus has the following goals:

- _Maintainability_: make build definitions maintainable by enabling modularity, code reuse and dependency resolution.
- _Efficiency_: make builds efficient by automatic parallelisation and fine-grained caching; provide tools for optimising the image size.
- _Expressiveness_: enable the user to express complex build workflows.
- _Simplicity_: provide minimalistic syntax, well-defined, non-Turing-complete semantics, and statically computed build graphs.

For more information, please check [documentation](http://docs.modus-continens.com/) and [installation guide](https://github.com/modus-continens/modus/blob/main/INSTALL.md). Modus uses semantic versioning; until version 1.0 is declared, breaking changes are possible. We welcome bug reports and feature requests submitted through [issues](https://github.com/mechtaev/modus/issues).
